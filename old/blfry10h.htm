<p>*******The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Blue Fairy Book*******

<p>*****This file should be named blfry10.txt or blfry10.zip******



<p>Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, blfry11.txt.

<p>VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, blfry10a.txt.

<p>We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.

<p>Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.

<br><br>
<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

<p>At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

<p>We need your donations more than ever!

<br><br>
<p>All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

<p>*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
<br>By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
<br>This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

<p>To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,

<p>If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

<p>INDEMNITY
<br>You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,

<p>Once upon a time in a certain country there lived a

king whose palace was surrounded by a spacious garden.

But, though the gardeners were many and the soil was

good, this garden yielded neither flowers nor fruits, not

even grass or shady trees.



<p>The King was in despair about it, when a wise old man

said to him:



<p>"Your gardeners do not understand their business: but

what can you expect of men whose fathers were cobblers

and carpenters? How should they have learned to cultivate

your garden?"



<p>"You are quite right," cried the King.



<p>"Therefore," continued the old man, "you should send

for a gardener whose father and grandfather have been

gardeners before him, and very soon your garden will be

full of green grass and gay flowers, and you will enjoy its

delicious fruit."



<p>So the King sent messengers to every town, village, and

hamlet in his dominions, to look for a gardener whose

forefathers had been gardeners also, and after forty days

one was found.



<p>"Come with us and be gardener to the King," they said

to him.



<p>"How can I go to the King," said the gardener, "a poor

wretch like me?"



<p>"That is of no consequence," they answered. "Here are

new clothes for you and your family."



<p>"But I owe money to several people."



<p>"We will pay your debts," they said.



<p>So the gardener allowed himself to be persuaded, and

went away with the messengers, taking his wife and his

son with him; and the King, delighted to have found a

real gardener, entrusted him with the care of his garden.

The man found no difficulty in making the royal garden

produce flowers and fruit, and at the end of a year the

park was not like the same place, and the King showered

gifts upon his new servant.



<p>The gardener, as you have heard already, had a son,

who was a very handsome young man, with most agree-

able manners, and every day he carried the best fruit of

the garden to the King, and all the prettiest flowers to his

daughter. Now this princess was wonderfully pretty and

was just sixteen years old, and the King was beginning

to think it was time that she should be married.



<p>"My dear child," said he, "you are of an age to take a

husband, therefore I am thinking of marrying you to the

son of my prime minister.



<p>"Father," replied the Princess, "I will never marry the

son of the minister."



<p>"Why not?" asked the King.



<p>"Because I love the gardener's son," answered the

Princess.



<p>On hearing this the King was at first very angry, and

then he wept and sighed, and declared that such a husband

was not worthy of his daughter; but the young

Princess was not to be turned from her resolution to

marry the gardener's son.



<p>Then the King consulted his ministers. "This is what

you must do," they said. "To get rid of the gardener you

must send both suitors to a very distant country, and the

one who returns first shall marry your daughter."



<p>The King followed this advice, and the minister's son

was presented with a splendid horse and a purse full of

gold pieces, while the gardener's son had only an old lame

horse and a purse full of copper money, and every one

thought he would never come back from his journey.



<p>The day before they started the Princess met her lover

and said to him:



<p>"Be brave, and remember always that I love you. Take

this purse full of jewels and make the best use you can of

them for love of me, and come back quickly and demand

my hand."



<p>The two suitors left the town together, but the

minister's son went off at a gallop on his good horse, and very

soon was lost to sight behind the most distant hills. He

traveled on for some days, and presently reached a fountain

beside which an old woman all in rags sat upon a

stone.



<p>"Good-day to you, young traveler," said she.



<p>But the minister's son made no reply.



<p>"Have pity upon me, traveler," she said again. "I am

dying of hunger, as you see, and three days have I been

here and no one has given me anything."



<p>"Let me alone, old witch," cried the young man; "I can

do nothing for you," and so saying he went on his way.



<p>That same evening the gardener's son rode up to the

fountain upon his lame gray horse.



<p>"Good-day to you, young traveler," said the beggar-

woman.



<p>"Good-day, good woman," answered he.



<p>"Young traveler, have pity upon me."



<p>Take my purse, good woman," said he, "and mount

behind me, for your legs can't be very strong."



<p>The old woman didn't wait to be asked twice, but

mounted behind him, and in this style they reached the

chief city of a powerful kingdom. The minister's son was

lodged in a grand inn, the gardener's son and the old

woman dismounted at the inn for beggars.



<p>The next day the gardener's son heard a great noise in

the street, and the King's heralds passed, blowing all

kinds of instruments, and crying:



<p>The King, our master, is old and infirm. He will give

a great reward to whoever will cure him and give him

back the strength of his youth."



<p>Then the old beggar-woman said to her benefactor:



<p>"This is what you must do to obtain the reward which

the King promises. Go out of the town by the south gate,

and there you will find three little dogs of different colors;

the first will be white, the second black, the third red. You

must kill them and then burn them separately, and gather

up the ashes. Put the ashes of each dog into a bag of its own

color, then go before the door of the palace and cry out,

`A celebrated physician has come from Janina in Albania.

He alone can cure the King and give him back the

strength of his youth.' The King's physicians will say,

This is an impostor, and not a learned man,' and they

will make all sorts of difficulties, but you will overcome

them all at last, and will present yourself before the sick

King. You must then demand as much wood as three

mules can carry, and a great cauldron, and must shut

yourself up in a room with the Sultan, and when the

cauldron boils you must throw him into it, and there leave

him until his flesh is completely separated from his bones.

Then arrange the bones in their proper places, and throw

over them the ashes out of the three bags. The King will

come back to life, and will be just as he was when he was

twenty years old. For your reward you must demand the

bronze ring which has the power to grant you everything

you desire. Go, my son, and do not forget any of my

instructions."



<p>The young man followed the old beggar-woman's

directions. On going out of the town he found the white,

red, and black dogs, and killed and burnt them, gathering

the ashes in three bags. Then he ran to the palace and

cried:



<p>"A celebrated physician has just come from Janina in

Albania. He alone can cure the King and give him back

the strength of his youth."



<p>The King's physicians at first laughed at the unknown

wayfarer, but the Sultan ordered that the stranger should

be admitted. They brought the cauldron and the loads

of wood, and very soon the King was boiling away.

Toward mid-day the gardener's son arranged the bones in

their places, and he had hardly scattered the ashes over

them before the old King revived, to find himself once

more young and hearty.



<p>"How can I reward you, my benefactor?" he cried.

"Will you take half my treasures?"



<p>"No," said the gardener's son.



<p>"My daughter's hand?"



<p>"NO."



<p>"Take half my kingdom."



<p>"No. Give me only the bronze ring which can instantly

grant me anything I wish for."



<p>"Alas!" said the King, "I set great store by that

marvelous ring; nevertheless, you shall have it." And he gave

it to him.



<p>The gardener's son went back to say good-by to the old

beggar-woman; then he said to the bronze ring:



<p>"Prepare a splendid ship in which I may continue my

journey. Let the hull be of fine gold, the masts of silver,

the sails of brocade; let the crew consist of twelve young

men of noble appearance, dressed like kings. St. Nicholas

will be at the helm. As to the cargo, let it be diamonds,

rubies, emeralds, and carbuncles."



<p>And immediately a ship appeared upon the sea which

resembled in every particular THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY THE

GARDENER'S SON, and, stepping on board, he continued his

journey. Presently he arrived at a great town and established

himself in a wonderful palace. After several days

he met his rival, the minister's son, who had spent all his

money and was reduced to the disagreeable employment

of a carrier of dust and rubbish. The gardener's son said

to him:



<p>"What is your name, what is your family, and from

what country do you come?"



<p>"I am the son of the prime minister of a great nation,

and yet see what a degrading occupation I am reduced

to."



<p>"Listen to me; though I don't know anything more

about you, I am willing to help you. I will give you a ship

to take you back to your own country upon one condition."



<p>"Whatever it may be, I accept it willingly."



<p>"Follow me to my palace."



<p>The minister's son followed the rich stranger, whom he

had not recognized. When they reached the palace the

gardener's son made a sign to his slaves, who completely

undressed the new-comer.



<p>"Make this ring red-hot," commanded the master, "and

mark the man with it upon his back."



<p>The slaves obeyed him.



<p>"Now, young man," said the rich stranger, "I am going

to give you a vessel which will take you back to your own

country."



<p>And, going out, he took the bronze ring and said:



<p>"Bronze ring, obey thy master. Prepare me a ship of

which the half-rotten timbers shall be painted black, let

the sails be in rags, and the sailors infirm and sickly. One

shall have lost a leg, another an arm, the third shall be a

hunchback, another lame or club-footed or blind, and

most of them shall be ugly and covered with scars. Go,

and let my orders be executed."



<p>The minister's son embarked in this old vessel, and

thanks to favorable winds, at length reached his own

country. In spite of the pitiable condition in which he

returned they received him joyfully.



<p>"I am the first to come back," said he to the King;

now fulfil your promise, and give me the princess in

marriage.



<p>So they at once began to prepare for the wedding

festivities. As to the poor princess, she was sorrowful and

angry enough about it.



<p>The next morning, at daybreak, a wonderful ship with

every sail set came to anchor before the town. The King

happened at that moment to be at the palace window.



<p>"What strange ship is this," he cried, "that has a

golden hull, silver masts, and silken sails, and who are the

young men like princes who man it? And do I not see St.

Nicholas at the helm? Go at once and invite the captain

of the ship to come to the palace."



<p>His servants obeyed him, and very soon in came an

enchantingly handsome young prince, dressed in rich

silk, ornamented with pearls and diamonds.



<p>"Young man," said the King, "you are welcome,

whoever you may be. Do me the favor to be my guest as long

as you remain in my capital."



<p>"Many thanks, sire," replied the captain, "I accept

your offer."



<p>"My daughter is about to be married," said the King;

"will you give her away?"



<p>"I shall be charmed, sire."



<p>Soon after came the Princess and her betrothed.



<p>"Why, how is this?" cried the young captain; "would

you marry this charming princess to such a man as that?"



<p>"But he is my prime minister's son!"



<p>"What does that matter? I cannot give your daughter

away. The man she is betrothed to is one of my servants."



<p>"Your servant?"



<p>"Without doubt. I met him in a distant town reduced

to carrying away dust and rubbish from the houses. I

had pity on him and engaged him as one of my servants."



<p>"It is impossible!" cried the King.



<p>"Do you wish me to prove what I say? This young man

returned in a vessel which I fitted out for him, an unsea-

worthy ship with a black battered hull, and the sailors

were infirm and crippled."



<p>"It is quite true," said the King.



<p>"It is false," cried the minister's son. "I do not know

this man!"



<p>"Sire," said the young captain, "order your daughter's

betrothed to be stripped, and see if the mark of my ring

is not branded upon his back."



<p>The King was about to give this order, when the

minister's son, to save himself from such an indignity,

admitted that the story was true.



<p>"And now, sire," said the young captain, "do you not

recognize me?"



<p>"I recognize you," said the Princess; "you are the

gardener's son whom I have always loved, and it is you

I wish to marry."



<p>"Young man, you shall be my son-in-law," cried the

King. "The marriage festivities are already begun, so you

shall marry my daughter this very day."



<p>And so that very day the gardener's son married the

beautiful Princess.



<p>Several months passed. The young couple were as

happy as the day was long, and the King was more and

more pleased with himself for having secured such a son-

in-law.



<p>But, presently, the captain of the golden ship found it

necessary to take a long voyage, and after embracing his

wife tenderly he embarked.



<p>Now in the outskirts of the capital there lived an old

man, who had spent his life in studying black arts--

alchemy, astrology, magic, and enchantment. This man

found out that the gardener's son had only succeeded in

marrying the Princess by the help of the genii who obeyed

the bronze ring.



<p>"I will have that ring," said he to himself. So he went

down to the sea-shore and caught some little red fishes.

Really, they were quite wonderfully pretty. Then he came

back, and, passing before the Princess's window, he began

to cry out:



<p>"Who wants some pretty little red fishes?"



<p>The Princess heard him, and sent out one of her slaves,

who said to the old peddler:



<p>"What will you take for your fish?"



<p>"A bronze ring."



<p>"A bronze ring, old simpleton! And where shall I find

one?"



<p>"Under the cushion in the Princess's room."



<p>The slave went back to her mistress.



<p>The old madman will take neither gold nor silver,"

said she.



<p>"What does he want then?"



<p>"A bronze ring that is hidden under a cushion."



<p>Find the ring and give it to him," said the Princess.



<p>And at last the slave found the bronze ring, which the

captain of the golden ship had accidentally left behind

and carried it to the man, who made off with it instantly.



<p>Hardly had he reached his own house when, taking the

ring, he said, "Bronze ring, obey thy master. I desire that

the golden ship shall turn to black wood, and the crew to

hideous negroes; that St. Nicholas shall leave the helm

and that the only cargo shall be black cats."



<p>And the genii of the bronze ring obeyed him.



<p>Finding himself upon the sea in this miserable

condition, the young captain understood that some one must

have stolen the bronze ring from him, and he lamented

his misfortune loudly; but that did him no good.



<p>"Alas!" he said to himself, "whoever has taken my ring

has probably taken my dear wife also. What good will it

do me to go back to my own country?" And he sailed

about from island to island, and from shore to shore,

believing that wherever he went everybody was laughing at

him, and very soon his poverty was so great that he and

his crew and the poor black cats had nothing to eat but

herbs and roots. After wandering about a long time he

reached an island inhabited by mice. The captain landed

upon the shore and began to explore the country. There

were mice everywhere, and nothing but mice. Some of

the black cats had followed him, and, not having been fed

for several days, they were fearfully hungry, and made

terrible havoc among the mice.



<p>Then the queen of the mice held a council.



<p>"These cats will eat every one of us," she said, "if the

captain of the ship does not shut the ferocious animals up.

Let us send a deputation to him of the bravest among us."



<p>Several mice offered themselves for this mission and set

out to find the young captain.



<p>"Captain," said they, "go away quickly from our island,

or we shall perish, every mouse of us."



<p>"Willingly," replied the young captain, "upon one

condition. That is that you shall first bring me back a bronze

ring which some clever magician has stolen from me. If

you do not do this I will land all my cats upon your

island, and you shall be exterminated."



<p>The mice withdrew in great dismay. "What is to be

done?" said the Queen. "How can we find this bronze

ring?" She held a new council, calling in mice from every

quarter of the globe, but nobody knew where the bronze

ring was. Suddenly three mice arrived from a very distant

country. One was blind, the second lame, and the

third had her ears cropped.



<p>"Ho, ho, ho!" said the new-comers. "We come from a

far distant country."



<p>"Do you know where the bronze ring is which the genii

obey?"



<p>"Ho, ho, ho! we know; an old sorcerer has taken

possession of it, and now he keeps it in his pocket by day and in

his mouth by night."



<p>"Go and take it from him, and come back as soon as

possible."



<p>So the three mice made themselves a boat and set sail

for the magician's country. When they reached the capital

they landed and ran to the palace, leaving only the

blind mouse on the shore to take care of the boat. Then

they waited till it was night. The wicked old man lay

down in bed and put the bronze ring into his mouth, and

very soon he was asleep.



<p>"Now, what shall we do?" said the two little animals to

each other.



<p>The mouse with the cropped ears found a lamp full of

oil and a bottle full of pepper. So she dipped her tail first

in the oil and then in the pepper, and held it to the

sorcerer's nose.



<p>"Atisha! atisha!" sneezed the old man, but he did not

wake, and the shock made the bronze ring jump out of his

mouth. Quick as thought the lame mouse snatched up the

precious talisman and carried it off to the boat.



<p>Imagine the despair of the magician when he awoke and

the bronze ring was nowhere to be found!



<p>But by that time our three mice had set sail with their

prize. A favoring breeze was carrying them toward the

island where the queen of the mice was awaiting them.

Naturally they began to talk about the bronze ring.



<p>"Which of us deserves the most credit?" they cried all

at once.



<p>"I do," said the blind mouse, "for without my

watchfulness our boat would have drifted away to the open sea."



<p>"No, indeed," cried the mouse with the cropped ears;

"the credit is mine. Did I not cause the ring to jump out

of the man's mouth?"



<p>"No, it is mine," cried the lame one, "for I ran off with

the ring."



<p>And from high words they soon came to blows, and,

alas! when the quarrel was fiercest the bronze ring fell into

the sea.



<p>"How are we to face our queen," said the three mice

"when by our folly we have lost the talisman and condemned

our people to be utterly exterminated? We cannot

go back to our country; let us land on this desert

island and there end our miserable lives." No sooner said

than done. The boat reached the island, and the mice

landed.



<p>The blind mouse was speedily deserted by her two

sisters, who went off to hunt flies, but as she wandered

sadly along the shore she found a dead fish, and was eating

it, when she felt something very hard. At her cries the

other two mice ran up.



<p>"It is the bronze ring! It is the talisman!" they cried

joyfully, and, getting into their boat again, they soon

reached the mouse island. It was time they did, for the

captain was just going to land his cargo of cats, when a

deputation of mice brought him the precious bronze ring.



<p>"Bronze ring," commanded the young man, "obey thy

master. Let my ship appear as it was before."



<p>Immediately the genii of the ring set to work, and the

old black vessel became once more the wonderful golden

ship with sails of brocade; the handsome sailors ran to the

silver masts and the silken ropes, and very soon they set

sail for the capital.



<p>Ah! how merrily the sailors sang as they flew over the

glassy sea!



<p>At last the port was reached.



<p>The captain landed and ran to the palace, where he

found the wicked old man asleep. The Princess clasped

her husband in a long embrace. The magician tried to

escape, but he was seized and bound with strong cords.



<p>The next day the sorcerer, tied to the tail of a savage

mule loaded with nuts, was broken into as many pieces as

there were nuts upon the mule's back.[1]

<p>Once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in

love with a princess, but she could not marry anyone,

because she was under an enchantment. So the King set out

to seek a fairy, and asked what he could do to win the

Princess's love. The Fairy said to him:



<p>"You know that the Princess has a great cat which she

is very fond of. Whoever is clever enough to tread on

that cat's tail is the man she is destined to marry."



<p>The King said to himself that this would not be very

difficult, and he left the Fairy, determined to grind the

cat's tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all.



<p>You may imagine that it was not long before he went

to see the Princess, and puss, as usual, marched in before

him, arching his back. The King took a long step, and

quite thought he had the tail under his foot, but the cat

turned round so sharply that he only trod on air. And so

it went on for eight days, till the King began to think that

this fatal tail must be full of quicksilver--it was never

still for a moment.



<p>At last, however, he was lucky enough to come upon

puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out.

So the King, without losing a moment, set his foot upon it

heavily.



<p>With one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly

changed into a tall man, who, fixing his angry eyes upon

the King, said:



<p>"You shall marry the Princess because you have been

able to break the enchantment, but I will have my

revenge. You shall have a son, who will never be happy

until he finds out that his nose is too long, and if you ever

tell anyone what I have just said to you, you shall vanish

away instantly, and no one shall ever see you or hear of

you again."



<p>Though the King was horribly afraid of the enchanter,

he could not help laughing at this threat.



<p>"If my son has such a long nose as that," he said to

himself, "he must always see it or feel it; at least, if he is

not blind or without hands."



<p>But, as the enchanter had vanished, he did not waste

any more time in thinking, but went to seek the Princess,

who very soon consented to marry him. But after all,

they had not been married very long when the King died,

and the Queen had nothing left to care for but her little

son, who was called Hyacinth. The little Prince had large

blue eyes, the prettiest eyes in the world, and a sweet

little mouth, but, alas! his nose was so enormous that it

covered half his face. The Queen was inconsolable when

she saw this great nose, but her ladies assured her that it

was not really as large as it looked; that it was a Roman

nose, and you had only to open any history to see that

every hero has a large nose. The Queen, who was devoted

to her baby, was pleased with what they told her, and

when she looked at Hyacinth again, his nose certainly did

not seem to her QUITE so large.



<p>The Prince was brought up with great care; and, as

soon as he could speak, they told him all sorts of dreadful

stories about people who had short noses. No one was

allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less

resemble his own, and the courtiers, to get into favor with

the Queen, took to pulling their babies' noses several

times every day to make them grow long. But, do what

they would, they were nothing by comparison with the

Prince's.



<p>When he grew sensible he learned history; and whenever

any great prince or beautiful princess was spoken of,

his teachers took care to tell him that they had long noses.



<p>His room was hung with pictures, all of people with

very large noses; and the Prince grew up so convinced

that a long nose was a great beauty, that he would not on

any account have had his own a single inch shorter!



<p>When his twentieth birthday was passed the Queen

thought it was time that he should be married, so she

commanded that the portraits of several princesses should

be brought for him to see, and among the others was a

picture of the Dear Little Princess!



<p>Now, she was the daughter of a great king, and would

some day possess several kingdoms herself; but Prince

Hyacinth had not a thought to spare for anything of that

sort, he was so much struck with her beauty. The Princess,

whom he thought quite charming, had, however, a

little saucy nose, which, in her face, was the prettiest

thing possible, but it was a cause of great embarrassment

to the courtiers, who had got into such a habit of laughing

at little noses that they sometimes found themselves

laughing at hers before they had time to think; but this

did not do at all before the Prince, who quite failed to see

the joke, and actually banished two of his courtiers who

had dared to mention disrespectfully the Dear Little

Princess's tiny nose!



<p>The others, taking warning from this, learned to think

twice before they spoke, and one even went so far as to

tell the Prince that, though it was quite true that no man

could be worth anything unless he had a long nose, still,

a woman's beauty was a different thing; and he knew a

learned man who understood Greek and had read in some

old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had

a "tip-tilted" nose!



<p>The Prince made him a splendid present as a reward for

this good news, and at once sent ambassadors to ask the

Dear Little Princess in marriage. The King, her father,

gave his consent; and Prince Hyacinth, who, in his anxiety

to see the Princess, had gone three leagues to meet her

was just advancing to kiss her hand when, to the horror

of all who stood by, the enchanter appeared as suddenly

as a flash of lightning, and, snatching up the Dear Little

Princess, whirled her away out of their sight!



<p>The Prince was left quite unconsolable, and declared

that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom

until he had found her again, and refusing to allow any of

his courtiers to follow him, he mounted his horse and rode

sadly away, letting the animal choose his own path.



<p>So it happened that he came presently to a great plain,

across which he rode all day long without seeing a single

house, and horse and rider were terribly hungry, when, as

the night fell, the Prince caught sight of a light, which

seemed to shine from a cavern.



<p>He rode up to it, and saw a little old woman, who

appeared to be at least a hundred years old.



<p>She put on her spectacles to look at Prince Hyacinth,

but it was quite a long time before she could fix them

securely because her nose was so very short.



<p>The Prince and the Fairy (for that was who she was)

had no sooner looked at one another than they went into

fits of laughter, and cried at the same moment, "Oh, what

a funny nose!"



<p>"Not so funny as your own," said Prince Hyacinth to

the Fairy; "but, madam, I beg you to leave the consideration

of our noses--such as they are--and to be good

enough to give me something to eat, for I am starving,

and so is my poor horse."



<p>"With all my heart," said the Fairy. "Though your nose

is so ridiculous you are, nevertheless, the son of my best

friend. I loved your father as if he had been my brother.

Now HE had a very handsome nose!"



<p>"And pray what does mine lack?" said the Prince.



<p>"Oh! it doesn't LACK anything," replied the Fairy. "On

the contrary quite, there is only too much of it. But

never mind, one may be a very worthy man though his

nose is too long. I was telling you that I was your father's

friend; he often came to see me in the old times, and you

must know that I was very pretty in those days; at least,

he used to say so. I should like to tell you of a conversation

we had the last time I ever saw him."



<p>"Indeed," said the Prince, "when I have supped it will

give me the greatest pleasure to hear it; but consider,

madam, I beg of you, that I have had nothing to eat

today."



<p>"The poor boy is right," said the Fairy; "I was

forgetting. Come in, then, and I will give you some supper, and

while you are eating I can tell you my story in a very few

words--for I don't like endless tales myself. Too long a

tongue is worse than too long a nose, and I remember

when I was young that I was so much admired for not

being a great chatterer. They used to tell the Queen, my

mother, that it was so. For though you see what I am

now, I was the daughter of a great king. My father----"



<p>"Your father, I dare say, got something to eat when he

was hungry!" interrupted the Prince.



<p>"Oh! certainly," answered the Fairy, "and you also

shall have supper directly. I only just wanted to tell

you----"



<p>"But I really cannot listen to anything until I have had

something to eat," cried the Prince, who was getting quite

angry; but then, remembering that he had better be

polite as he much needed the Fairy's help, he added:



<p>"I know that in the pleasure of listening to you I should

quite forget my own hunger; but my horse, who cannot

hear you, must really be fed!"



<p>The Fairy was very much flattered by this compliment,

and said, calling to her servants:



<p>"You shall not wait another minute, you are so polite,

and in spite of the enormous size of your nose you are

really very agreeable."



<p>"Plague take the old lady! How she does go on about

my nose!" said the Prince to himself. "One would almost

think that mine had taken all the extra length that hers

lacks! If I were not so hungry I would soon have done

with this chatterpie who thinks she talks very little! How

stupid people are not to see their own faults! That comes

of being a princess: she has been spoiled by flatterers, who

have made her believe that she is quite a moderate talker!"



<p>Meanwhile the servants were putting the supper on the

table, and the prince was much amused to hear the Fairy

who asked them a thousand questions simply for the

pleasure of hearing herself speak; especially he noticed

one maid who, no matter what was being said, always

contrived to praise her mistress's wisdom.



<p>"Well!" he thought, as he ate his supper, "I'm very glad

I came here. This just shows me how sensible I have been

in never listening to flatterers. People of that sort praise

us to our faces without shame, and hide our faults or

change them into virtues. For my part I never will be

taken in by them. I know my own defects, I hope."



<p>Poor Prince Hyacinth! He really believed what he said,

and hadn't an idea that the people who had praised his

nose were laughing at him, just as the Fairy's maid was

laughing at her; for the Prince had seen her laugh slyly

when she could do so without the Fairy's noticing her.



<p>However, he said nothing, and presently, when his

hunger began to be appeased, the Fairy said:



<p>"My dear Prince, might I beg you to move a little more

that way, for your nose casts such a shadow that I really

cannot see what I have on my plate. Ah! thanks. Now

let us speak of your father. When I went to his Court he

was only a little boy, but that is forty years ago, and I

have been in this desolate place ever since. Tell me what

goes on nowadays; are the ladies as fond of amusement as

ever? In my time one saw them at parties, theatres, balls,

and promenades every day. Dear me! WHAT a long nose

you have! I cannot get used to it!"



<p>"Really, madam," said the Prince, "I wish you would

leave off mentioning my nose. It cannot matter to you

what it is like. I am quite satisfied with it, and have no

wish to have it shorter. One must take what is given one."



<p>"Now you are angry with me, my poor Hyacinth," said

the Fairy, "and I assure you that I didn't mean to vex

you; on the contrary, I wished to do you a service. However,

though I really cannot help your nose being a shock

to me, I will try not to say anything about it. I will even

try to think that you have an ordinary nose. To tell the

truth, it would make three reasonable ones."



<p>The Prince, who was no longer hungry, grew so impatient

at the Fairy's continual remarks about his nose that

at last he threw himself upon his horse and rode hastily

away. But wherever he came in his journeyings he thought

the people were mad, for they all talked of his nose, and

yet he could not bring himself to admit that it was too

long, he had been so used all his life to hear it called handsome.



<p>The old Fairy, who wished to make him happy, at last

hit upon a plan. She shut the Dear Little Princess up in

a palace of crystal, and put this palace down where the

Prince would not fail to find it. His joy at seeing the

Princess again was extreme, and he set to work with all

his might to try to break her prison; but in spite of all his

efforts he failed utterly. In despair he thought at least

that he would try to get near enough to speak to the Dear

Little Princess, who, on her part, stretched out her hand

that he might kiss it; but turn which way he might, he

never could raise it to his lips, for his long nose always

prevented it. For the first time he realized how long it

really was, and exclaimed:



<p>"Well, it must be admitted that my nose IS too long!"



<p>In an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand

splinters, and the old Fairy, taking the Dear Little Princess

by the hand, said to the Prince:



<p>"Now, say if you are not very much obliged to me.

Much good it was for me to talk to you about your nose!

You would never have found out how extraordinary it

was if it hadn't hindered you from doing what you wanted

to. You see how self-love keeps us from knowing our own

defects of mind and body. Our reason tries in vain to

show them to us; we refuse to see them till we find them

in the way of our interests."



<p>Prince Hyacinth, whose nose was now just like anyone's

else, did not fail to profit by the lesson he had

received. He married the Dear Little Princess, and they

lived happily ever after.[1]

<p>Once upon a time there was a poor husbandman who

had many children and little to give them in the way

either of food or clothing. They were all pretty, but the

prettiest of all was the youngest daughter, who was so

beautiful that there were no bounds to her beauty.



<p>So once--it was late on a Thursday evening in autumn,

and wild weather outside, terribly dark, and raining so

heavily and blowing so hard that the walls of the cottage

shook again--they were all sitting together by the fireside,

each of them busy with something or other, when

suddenly some one rapped three times against the window-

pane. The man went out to see what could be the matter,

and when he got out there stood a great big white bear.



<p>"Good-evening to you," said the White Bear.



<p>"Good-evening," said the man.



<p>"Will you give me your youngest daughter?" said the

White Bear; "if you will, you shall be as rich as you are

now poor.



<p>Truly the man would have had no objection to be rich,

but he thought to himself: "I must first ask my daughter

about this," so he went in and told them that there was a

great white bear outside who had faithfully promised to

make them all rich if he might but have the youngest

daughter.



<p>She said no, and would not hear of it; so the man went

out again, and settled with the White Bear that he should

come again next Thursday evening, and get her answer.

Then the man persuaded her, and talked so much to her

about the wealth that they would have, and what a good

thing it would be for herself, that at last she made up her

mind to go, and washed and mended all her rags, made

herself as smart as she could, and held herself in readiness

to set out. Little enough had she to take away with her.



<p>Next Thursday evening the White Bear came to fetch

her. She seated herself on his back with her bundle, and

thus they departed. When they had gone a great part of

the way, the White Bear said: "Are you afraid?"



<p>"No, that I am not," said she.



<p>" Keep tight hold of my fur, and then there is no

danger," said he.



<p>And thus she rode far, far away, until they came to a

great mountain. Then the White Bear knocked on it, and

a door opened, and they went into a castle where there

were many brilliantly lighted rooms which shone with

gold and silver, likewise a large hall in which there was a

well-spread table, and it was so magnificent that it would

be hard to make anyone understand how splendid it was.

The White Bear gave her a silver bell, and told her that

when she needed anything she had but to ring this bell,

and what she wanted would appear. So after she had

eaten, and night was drawing near, she grew sleepy after

her journey, and thought she would like to go to bed.

She rang the bell, and scarcely had she touched it before

she found herself in a chamber where a bed stood ready

made for her, which was as pretty as anyone could wish

to sleep in. It had pillows of silk, and curtains of silk

fringed with gold, and everything that was in the room

was of gold or silver, but when she had lain down and

put out the light a man came and lay down beside her,

and behold it was the White Bear, who cast off the form

of a beast during the night. She never saw him, however,

for he always came after she had put out her light, and

went away before daylight appeared.



<p>So all went well and happily for a time, but then she

began to be very sad and sorrowful, for all day long she

had to go about alone; and she did so wish to go home to

her father and mother and brothers and sisters. Then the

White Bear asked what it was that she wanted, and she

told him that it was so dull there in the mountain, and

that she had to go about all alone, and that in her parents'

house at home there were all her brothers and sisters, and

it was because she could not go to them that she was so

sorrowful.



<p>"There might be a cure for that," said the White Bear,

"if you would but promise me never to talk with your

mother alone, but only when the others are there too; for

she will take hold of your hand," he said, "and will want

to lead you into a room to talk with you alone; but that

you must by no means do, or you will bring great misery

on both of us."



<p>So one Sunday the White Bear came and said that they

could now set out to see her father and mother, and they

journeyed thither, she sitting on his back, and they went

a long, long way, and it took a long, long time; but at last
